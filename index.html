<br>The world building within Yakuza 0 and how vast the world within the game is makes the game very appealing and attention-grabbing. I could continously play this</br>
<br>game without much of issue, because when I would get bored doing one thing. I would proceeded to do another. The world building within the game keeps you invested</br>
<br>while the actual mechanics keep you amused.</br>
<br>The character designs are neat. You c an differenciate between characters and their styles and designs are all unique yet realistic, fitting for the aesthetic of</br>
<br>the game.</br>
